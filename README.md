# Kahoot-Replica

𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐞: This game is BY NO MEANS COMMERCIAL. I am not affiliated with Kahoot at all, I just wanted to make this cool project for whoever would like to run it on their computer for absolutely free. However, I do encourage whoever is running my Kahoot replica to play the real Kahoot and see how similar this is.

"Kahoot Replica" is a local multiplayer quiz game to be played on 2 or more separate computers on the same WiFi. This game is inspired by the popular quiz game "Kahoot" because it simulates how Kahoot is played on their website "kahoot.it". Although this project of mine is not a website, it combines Python sockets with Python's library "pygame" to simulate the real version of Kahoot. The goal of the game is to score the most points out of all the players playing by answering each multiple-choice question correctly and quickly.

𝐓𝐨 𝐫𝐮𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬: Get 2 or more separate WINDOWS computers on the same WiFi. On both computers: have Python 3 or greater installed, place all of the files in this repository in the same directory by downloading a zip file containing all files in this repository and extracting the zip file to the same directory. On the computer for running the main Kahoot screen, run "server.py" and follow the instructions generated. When the output says "listening for connections," a pygame window should pop up. For anyone that wants to play this as a player, run "client.py" 𝐀𝐅𝐓𝐄𝐑 𝐒𝐄𝐑𝐕𝐄𝐑.𝐏𝐘 𝐈𝐒 𝐑𝐔𝐍𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐌𝐀𝐈𝐍 𝐁𝐎𝐀𝐑𝐃 𝐏𝐘𝐆𝐀𝐌𝐄 𝐖𝐈𝐍𝐃𝐎𝐖 𝐇𝐀𝐒 𝐏𝐎𝐏𝐏𝐄𝐃 𝐔𝐏 𝐎𝐍 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐄𝐑𝐕𝐄𝐑'𝐒 𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐏𝐔𝐓𝐄𝐑 and follow the instructions generated. Also, install the packages "pygame" and "pandas" if these libraries aren't recognized when running either "client.py" or "server.py" or any other packages for libraries that aren't recognized."
